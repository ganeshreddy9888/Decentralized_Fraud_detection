# Online Banking Fraud Detection (Decentralized Approach)

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in online banking systems using machine learning techniques. It also explores decentralized data handling to enhance security and privacy.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Fraud_Detection_Decentralised.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code for data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- (Optional) `data/`: Directory where transaction datasets can be stored.
- (Optional) `models/`: Directory to store trained models.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- SMOTE for class balancing
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC

## ⚙️ Features

- Handles imbalanced datasets
- Uses cross-validation and model comparison
- Visualizes ROC curves and feature importances
- Focuses on secure, decentralized data principles (conceptual level)
